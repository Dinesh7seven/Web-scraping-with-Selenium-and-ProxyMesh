# Web-scraping-with-Selenium-and-ProxyMesh

This is a complex but interesting project! It combines web automation, proxy handling, data storage, and front-end development. Here's the approach:
Steps to Implement
1. Selenium Script to Fetch Twitter Trends
Automate login to Twitter.
Scrape the top 5 trending topics from the "Whatâ€™s Happening" section.
Use ProxyMesh to change the IP address for each request.
2. MongoDB Storage
Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Create a unique ID for each run of the script.
Save data fields as specified.
3. HTML Interface
Create an HTML page with a button to trigger the Selenium script.
Display the results dynamically after the script runs.
Show a JSON extract of the MongoDB record.
4. Integration
Use Flask (or Django) to connect the backend (Python script + MongoDB) with the front-end (HTML page).
